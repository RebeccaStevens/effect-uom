# Effect Units of Measure

Typesafe units for Effect.

## Usage

Example:

```ts
import * as uom from "effect-uom";

const width = uom.Meter(5);
const height = uom.Meter(3);
const area = uom.mul(width, height);
// `area` will be of type `Square<Meter>` which is equivalent to `Unit<{ Meter: 2 }>`.

useArea(area);
useVolume(area); // type error - `Square<Meter>` is not assignable to `Cubic<Length>`.

function useArea<A extends uom.Square<uom.Length>>(area: A) {
  // ...
}

function useVolume<V extends uom.Cubic<uom.Length>>(volume: V) {
  // ...
}
```

### UOM Types

This library uses [uom-types](https://github.com/RebeccaStevens/uom-types) as its base and
re-exports everything from it. See the [uom-types docs](https://rebeccastevens.github.io/uom-types/)
for more information.
